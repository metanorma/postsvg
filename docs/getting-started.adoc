== Purpose

This guide helps you get started with Postsvg, from installation through your first successful PostScript to SVG conversion.

Whether you're converting a single file or processing batches, validating PostScript documents, or integrating Postsvg into your application, this section provides the foundational knowledge you need.

== Concepts

**PostScript**:: A page description language used for printing and graphics. PostScript files contain commands that describe how to draw vector graphics.

**EPS (Encapsulated PostScript)**:: A subset of PostScript designed for embedding graphics in documents. EPS files include a BoundingBox comment that defines the graphic's dimensions.

**SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)**:: An XML-based vector graphics format supported by all modern web browsers. SVG can scale to any size without loss of quality.

**Conversion Pipeline**:: The process of reading PostScript commands, interpreting them, and generating equivalent SVG markup.
