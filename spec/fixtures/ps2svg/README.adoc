= PS2SVG test fixtures

== Acknowledgments

Thank you to Emmett Lalish for open-sourcing the ps2svg project and
providing these valuable test fixtures!

== Purpose

These test fixtures are from the https://github.com/elalish/ps2svg[ps2svg]
project open sourced under the MIT License.

We use these PostScript files and their expected SVG outputs to validate the
correctness of our implementation.

The test suite includes various PostScript files covering different features and
use cases, helping ensure our implementation produces accurate SVG output.


== Test files

The following test files are included:

* `colors.ps` - Tests RGB and CMYK color conversion. The expected SVG output file is
  `colors_expected.svg`.
* `example_full.ps` - Comprehensive PostScript feature test. The expected SVG output file is
  `example_full_expected.svg`.
* `file.ps` - Basic file conversion test. The expected SVG output file is
  `file_expected.svg`.
* `prog.ps` - PostScript program execution test. The expected SVG output file is `prog_expected.svg`.
* `img.ps` - Image-related PostScript operations. The expected SVG output file is `ref.svg`.
